# projectWebData

##Presentation 
This project aims at the generation of fake GPS data. This project contains two major ideas:
- First, being able to generate consecutive positions of an imaginary person given a certain timeline of events. This part uses road maps to generate the consecutive positions. 

- Second, given a certain GPS trace, being able to determine wether it is fake or not. This part relies on statistical analysis of GPS trace, and also on the use of road maps to decide wether it comes from real measurments, or not.


##TODO 
- [x] setup GitHub.
- [ ] Add XML Schemas (or DTD) for the datatypes used.
- [ ] Write very simple functionnal programs
- [ ] Import road data from either OpenStreetMap or GoogleMaps
- [ ] (Optional) Take into account traffic informations, traffic lights, data from counting measurments...


##Usage
